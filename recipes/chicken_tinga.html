        <p>Chicken tinga (also known as tinga de pollo) is a traditional Mexican dish featuring shredded 
            chicken stewed in a sauce typically made up of tomatoes, chili peppers / chipotle chilis, onion

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

            <li>1 1/2 cup (225 g) white onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chipotle paste (use 3 tbsp if you want it spicier)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (360 g) chopped tomatoes from a can</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the oil to the Instant Pot and press the "Sauté" button. Once the oil is warm, add the onion 
                and garlic to the pot and sauté about 4 minutes until tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chipotle paste, tomatoes, oregano and chicken stock and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken.</li>
            <li>Press the "Keep Warm/Cancel" button to stop the sauté function. Secure the lid and make sure the 
                steam valve is set to closed. Press 'Manual' or 'Pressure Cook' and set the timer to 10 minutes. 
                After the time is up the Instant Pot will automatically switch the keep warm. Switch the valve 
                immediately to allow for venting.</li>
            <li>Once the steam has been fully released remove the lid of the instant pot. Remove the chicken breasts 
                and set aside on a chopping board.</li>
            <li>Turn the Instant Pot to 'Sauté' and bring the sauce to a boil. Let the sauce simmer/boil and thicken 
                for about 10 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering shred the chicken breasts with a couple of forks.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened, taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed. Stir the shredded 
                chicken back into the sauce. Enjoy serve with your favourite toppings or in tacos, burritos, bowls or 
                straight out of the pot.</li>
        </ol>
