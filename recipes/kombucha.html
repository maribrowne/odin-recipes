        <h3>Sparkling, fruity kombucha that's ready to drink!</h3>
            <p>Kombucha is a slightly sparkling sour tonic beverage, similar to the popular Russian drink kvaas 
            (which is made from fermented rye bread). Kombucha, however, is a fermented, sweetened tea, cultured 
            with a SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) which as the name suggests, is one big wobbly 
            culture made of all manner of bacterial goodies. SCOBYs have garnered quite a reputation amongst kombucha-lovers 
            for their somewhat unappetising appearance – once one's been floating in the tank a while, it’s a rather 
            terrifying looking thing that wouldn’t look out of place in any of the Alien films. SCOBYs are beautiful 
            things though – full of nutrients with a texture and flavour somewhat similar to lychee. They float in 
            the tea solution, left to feed off the sugars in the tea, creating a slightly sparkling liquid with 
            minuscule levels of alcohol.</p>

            <p>Kombucha is said to have originated in China and has become popular in many countries since, particularly the USA. 
            More recently it's been grabbing attention on these shores, thanks to a wave of interest in healthy probiotics. 
            Although some of the more outlandish health claims surrounding kombucha haven’t been proven, the ‘good bacteria’ 
            in the beverage is good for the immune system – though if you’re drinking shop-bought, make sure it hasn’t been 
            pasteurised or all of the good bacteria will have been killed!
            The recipe below is from chef Dean Parker, head chef at The Manor in Clapham, who uses kombucha for all kinds of 
            creative recipes; soft drinks, vinegars, sorbets, dressings and cocktails to name a few.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 L water, filtered</li>
            <li>100g of sugar</li>
            <li>4g of loose-leaf tea</li>
            <li>1 kombucha SCOBY</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you start, make sure all of your equipment has been sterilised. Boil the water and sugar in a pan and pour over the 
            loose leaf tea</li>
            <li>Set the tea aside overnight, then strain and submerge the SCOBY in the tea (only handle it with very clean hands or latex gloves),
            using a sterilised weight to make sure it is fully submerged. Usually this is done in a large glass jar with muslin cloth tightly 
            covering the top (do not place a tight-fitting lid on initially as the build-up of gasses could make it pop off)</li>
            <li>Leave to ferment at an ideal temperature of 15–20°C for 5–7 days depending on the temperature and humidity (in the summer it will 
            ferment faster than in winter)</li>
            <li>Taste after 5 days, then every day after until you’re happy with the balance of sweetness and acidity – the longer it is left, the 
            sharper it will be as the sugar gets eaten up by the SCOBY</li>
            <li>Once you’re pleased with the flavour, you can transfer to bottles for a second fermentation or carbonation process. Use either swing 
            top bottles or plastic bottles (which have more give than glass, so there's less chance of them exploding if there's too much pressure)</li>
            <li>You can re-use your SCOBY by putting it straight into another batch of tea or store in tea in the fridge – but discard that liquid 
            when you’re ready to start your next fermentation. The SCOBY will grow with each fermentation – you can remove the extra layers 
            and any straggly bits to stop it from growing too big</li>
            <li>Leave the decanted bottles for 1–3 days to carbonate at room temperature. If using swing-top bottles, open them slightly each day 
                and you’ll be able to hear fizzing once it’s started to carbonate. If using plastic bottles you can tell when they’re ready as they 
                will have expanded slightly and have less give when squeezed. Place in the fridge to stop further carbonation and drink after one month. 
                You can drink straight away but the flavour does benefit from a little ageing</li>
        </ol>
